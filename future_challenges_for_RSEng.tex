\abstract{It's 2025 and we are, admittedly, still working on establishing and growing Research Software Engineering (RSE)
as a domain in its own right, with the hope of ensuring that it gets the recognition it deserves.
Nonetheless, as the use of digital tools becomes ever more pervasive in a researcher's day-to-day tasks, there are already people suggesting that RSE will
cease to exist as a separate field, and the specialist skills that RSEs provide to support and undertake research will
become a core part of the tooling and skill set of researchers in almost all other domains.
+Are we already approaching ``the end of Research Software Engineering''?! While we believe that it is certainly too early to
already herald the demise of RSE as a separate field,

\section{Introduction}

Research Software Engineering is currently an emerging field,
with an increasing integration into various aspects of research.
In this opinion paper, we try to imagine the state of our field
and community in the mid-term future, focusing on future challenges.
We present here the results of a workshop discussion at the
deRSE25 conference in Karlsruhe\cite{Goth2025EndRSEng}, without
claiming to represent the entire deRSE community.
Nevertheless, by disseminating the discussed ideas,
we aim to engage the community in imagining the future.
In the following sections, we consider the evolution of the RSE definition,
the development of RSE education,
the impact of automation and generative artificial intelligence in RSE work,
the emerging ethical considerations,
and the transformations expected in the research organizations,
and if there will be other in academia covered by new RTPs (\emph{Research Technical Professional}s).
We conclude the paper with a summary and with our wishes and recommendations.

\section{Aspects of this future}
%\subsection{What do we want to have achieved by 2035}
Looking ahead over a 10-year timeframe, we hope that the RSE community will have
contributed to make research software and its outputs
more sustainable, robust and maintainable. We see this happening in a number of ways. However,
we want to ensure that one of the core achievements made by the RSE community in this time
frame is putting the infrastructure and training opportunities in place, alongside the necessary
advocacy, to ensure that researchers receive core software skills as part of their scientific training.
With development of software tools and scripted workflows becoming an increasingly important part of everyday
research activities, this is vital and it will allow RSEs to focus on other more advanced and specialist
areas. In this context, we do not foresee the demise of RSE as an independent role. However, we
do see the work of RSEs developing and shifting as the research community changes.

The specialist skills that RSEs provide take a significant amount of time to develop and maintain.
We would, therefore, not expect domain researchers to also become experts in a range of
advanced RSE topics. 
At the same time, we do recognise that the application of core software development best practices
to enhance and address problems with research codebases, that can often make up the bulk of
current RSE work, will change. As noted above, these are skills that we
would expect any researcher who writes code to have in 10 years time. 
The rapid development of AI means that researchers are likely to have access to tooling that can assist
them in writing robust, sustainable code, lowering the barrier to developing code, or at least changing the
required skill set to some extent.
They can also be expected to have an understanding of frameworks to support testing, packaging and
deployment of their code as well as integration with central domain specific infrastructures.
Again, all these skills will, we anticipate, be gained as part of training infrastructure that will
provide domain scientists with software development expertise as part of their core scientific training.

So where do RSEs fit into this picture? Even today we expect to see RSEs providing technical skills and input
to research activities in a range of different areas, such as
High-quality, robust architecture and design for research software,
Seamless integration with research and data infrastructures,
Development of software for novel and emerging architectures,
Application of specialist numerical and statistical methods within software,
Optimisation of codes for use on high-performance computing infrastructure,
and Green computing - efficient implementations of algorithms/methods and use of hardware

It is already difficult to structure the spectrum of RSE tasks and responsibilities today (FIXME: Willi Hasselbrings classification paper?)
and it is even more hopeless to structure the aspects that will become relavant for the RSE community in the future.
Nevertheless, we decided to consider
\begin{itemize}
\item The evolution of the term RSE,
\item Development of the RSE community,
\item What the impact of AI to the work of RSEs will look like,
\item the impact of Complexity and Usability in Research Software
\item Ethics and social considerations,
\item How education is reshaped by the digital transformation,
\item Changes to the Academic Institutions,
\item Impact of alternate career paths for RSEs and other RTPs.
\end{itemize}

\begin{story}{Introduction}{intro}
In order to give a more explicit setting, imagine a world ten years from now.
Not too much to be overwhelmingly far in the future, but distant enough for some changes to occur.
Over this timeframe Kim\cite{Anzt2021} and Kay\cite{Goth2024}
were able to ride the waves of their career in Research Software Engineering and are now pondering early retirement on a sunset blessed beach.
%MM-NOTE: the above scenario (early retirement) is contrary to all trends in retirement age development of public employees across the "global north".
But the world has moved on.
When they look back, what will they see as problems which are now solved?
Which tasks are persisting, where they are now happy that a younger generation is now taking up the baton and carries forward their work.
What issues have newly emerged, where they are now just happy to say: “Oh well… My successor takes care of that”.\\
In order to bring this future to life these two personas will accompany us and we will shed light on certain aspects
of their future in respective small story boxes.
 \end{story}


\subsection{Definition and Evolution of RSEs}
\begin{whatis}{What do we want to have achieved}{ethics}
The term RSE is established in the minds of university boards, as a valuable member in the academic framework.
RSEs are developed using specialized master's program, and their support is valued by researchers. We still teach researchers basic software skills, but the content of this lecture has changed drastically.
\end{whatis}
% Here we consider how the topics of RSEng will change in the face of the digitalization of society.
% Also here: What will our topics be after version control doesn't need to be taught anymore?
% Digitalisation will also feature more heavily in the domain curricula.
In this discussions the workshop participants found that
the digital skills of domain scientists will increase,
and software will become easier to interact with,
reducing reliance on RSEs to train newcomers on the most basic tasks
(JN: for example, versioning and archiving?)
(GC: Higher-level and more intuitive workflows that require less training).
User training sessions might focus on more advanced topics
that cater to a smaller audience, or involve mentoring more frequently.

While the RSE core competencies\cite{Goth2024} might remain unchanged,
there might be a shift in the responsibilities of RSEs,
in the form of a partial reallocation of the training budget
to the other core competencies.
Regarding the definition of RSEs, we will still have a spectrum of competencies,
from full professional RSEs to domain scientists who develop research software.

What will \emph{not} change over that timeframe is the RSE's ability to remain
flexible and embrace change. Keep an eye open and pick up tools and skills
as needed as we go along.
Communication and collaboration skills will remain essential to engage
with domain scientists and help them find technical solutions.\\

Looking at that on a broader scale, especially the education aspect deserves some attention.\\
The Covid-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for the digital transformation
of higher education\cite{Bygstad2022}. Students and early-career researchers
are now more familiar with digital learning tools, which lead to a shift
in the responsibilities of teachers. To quote from the original study,
``with so many digital resources at hand,
the task of the lecturer will be fewer lectures,
and to act more as a facilitator of resources,
and to monitor activities and results over time.''\cite{Bygstad2022}

RSE-relevant open educational resources and master's programmes are tracked
in the Learning and Teaching RSE database\footnote{\url{https://de-rse.org/learn-and-teach/}}
and UK SSI resources hub\footnote{\url{https://www.software.ac.uk/resource-hub}}.
The Carpentries now offer specialised software workshops
for data scientists\footnote{\url{https://datacarpentry.org}},
librarians\footnote{\url{https://librarycarpentry.org}},
and soon HPC practitioners\footnote{\url{https://www.hpc-carpentry.org}}.

\begin{story}{The Definition of RSEs}{defrse}
A story, about how Kim and Kay started out with a certain job description that now totally
has changed meaning.
\end{story}

\subsection{Development of the RSE community}
\begin{whatis}{What do we want to have achieved}{ethics}
We have more national RSE communities that are interacting with other partners in their nation.
There are regular international conferences. The installation of RSE Master's programmes led to
increased numbers of the members of the national societies.
\end{whatis}
In recent years, we saw the formation of RSE institutes and advocacy groups, such as
the UK Software Sustainability Institute\footnote{\url{https://www.software.ac.uk}},
the US Research Software Sustainability Institute\footnote{\url{https://urssi.us}},
the European Virtual Institute for Research Software Excellence\footnote{\url{https://everse.software}},
and the EOSC Opportunity Area Expert Group 7 on Research Software%
\footnote{\url{https://eosc.eu/opportunity-area-exp/oa7-research-software}}.
We expect these initiatives to help increase the visibility and accelerate
the professionalisation%
\footnote{MM: do we want to decide for UK or US English? Or keep it mixed? Not being a native English speaker I don't know how it reads.}
of the RSE role.
In addition, a multitude of RSE communities self-organised at the national
and regional level to support more viable RSE career paths in academia.
We can expect RSEs to become more easily accessible,
possibly through centrally-funded long-term positions at research institutions.
The community of RSE's will get a significant boost in their acceptance if RSE Masters programmes
become available at various universities.

\subsection{Impact of AI and automation}
\begin{whatis}{What do we want to have achieved}{ai}
RSEs are educated about AI models, and can help researchers reap their benefits, while
clearly knowing their limits.
\end{whatis}
AI is already transforming research processes by enabling rapid analysis of massive datasets, uncovering patterns and insights that would be impossible or prohibitively time-consuming for humans alone to find.
In research and development, AI accelerates scientific breakthroughs in fields like healthcare, climate science, and materials engineering by automating complex modeling and predictive tasks.
For software development, AI-powered tools automate code generation, bug detection, and testing, significantly increasing productivity and reducing human error.
Developers are shifting from manual coding to orchestrating AI-driven workflows, focusing more on high-level design, integration, and creative problem-solving while AI handles repetitive or routine tasks.
The integration of AI is democratizing access to advanced technologies and analytics, enabling non-experts to participate in research and software creation, and fostering greater collaboration across disciplines.
As AI continues to evolve, it will further blur the lines between human and machine roles, making research and software development faster, more efficient, and more innovative than ever before.
With the general availability of AI the interaction with researchers will change at a fundamental level.
Whereas previously RSEs have been points of knowledge that could translate human language formulated problems into technical descriptions and then provide solutions to it,
It can be foreseen, that AI drives this low-key interaction to a highly specialized level of knowledge,
since AI copilots are available 24/7.

Currently we are expanding and documenting our work in the open and making our code available,
therefore there will be more structured material to train GenAI on.
However, as people get quicker answers from GenAI, the community resources (\eg Stack Overflow, Wikipedia)
get poorer.

\begin{story}{The interaction of RSEs with AI}{RSEs_with_AI}

\end{story}

\subsection{Impact of Complexity and Usability in Research Software}
\begin{whatis}{What do we want to have achieved}{abstraction}
Gerasimos? Jan?
\end{whatis}

The workshop participants found that, in earlier learning stages,
training may abstract away complexities that will always be present in research.
For this reason, the participants fear that the capability of researchers to deal with complexity
of software frameworks and libraries will reduce over time.
As a result, RSEs will need to invest more effort in making the interfaces of individual research software components
less complex, as the user experience expectations of researchers will continue to grow.
Participants expect an over-reliance on generative AI tools as an extreme manifestation of this issue.
No concrete examples were given on which complexities are now hidden behind abstractions.

We acknowledge but would also like to challenge the observations of the participants.
We believe that ``we are standing on the shoulders of giants'':
By reducing the complexity of individual software components,
we are now able to develop systems of complexity and capability not previously possible.
This divide-and-conquer approach allows the scientific community to address questions not previously in grasp.
When it comes to teaching, it is true that students need to learn how to handle complexity,
by being able to develop deep understanding of individual components.
However, it is also important to learn how to manage complexity
by building hierarchical systems of well-encapsulated, reusable components.
It is clear that we need both RSEs that can dive deep into single projects of significant complexity,
as well as RSEs that can manage complex systems of almost black-box components,
and the future of RSE education should aim to prepare students for both roles.

\subsection{Ethics and social consideration}
\begin{whatis}{What do we want to have achieved}{ethics}
Oh well..., is there really something that we could have achieved here?
maybe open Science? Data awareness? Data Protection?
\end{whatis}

The ethics and values of the Research Software Engineer are grounded in their practice.
They commit to the health, safety and welfare of the public and act in the interest of society, their employer and their clients \cite{Goth2023}.

% institutional bonds and ethics
Sometimes these values are in direct conflict with the aims of their institution. For example, their PI might insist on quickly developing some software without adhering to current best practices.
A code of ethics and professional conduct for RSEs should be developed by institutions together with RSEs themselves. This can then form the basis for institutional policies and guidelines.

% society implications
The technology people working as RSE might have, well directly or indirectly, ethical implications in areas such as social engineering [TODO find source], climate [TODO find source] and more.
Another example might be that they are developing code that can also be used for military purposes, such as numerical solvers or computer vision systems.
Like engineers, RSEs take the responsibility for the software they develop.
RSEs need to be aware of these issues and develop their own ``red lines''.

% data ethics
Similarly to how data collected by scientists should adhere to the FAIR principles \cite{FAIR}, research software developed by RSEs should adhere to the FAIR4RS principles~\cite{FAIR4RS}.

A code of ethics and professional conduct for RSEs should be developed by institutions together with RSEs themselves.
This can then form the basis for institutional policies and guidelines.

MM-NOTE: (Flo believes it was from Michele) Are we assuming that progress will bring prosperity? Will we remain constrained by needing to produce products/artifacts? (GC: Where "product/artifacts", maybe also "publications"?)

  - Importance of having personal “red lines” and awareness of how software can be used.

\begin{story}{The greater world of Kim and Kay}{ethics}
10 years have passed since Kim and Kay have started on their journey of being RSEs. Back then,
at the universities of Eden and Utopia, life was more orderly and harmonious. Kay is working in a project that develops
software for cheap water monitoring devices in the global south. Kim is currently designing the software service stack
at her university, and increasingly struggles to find compelling Open Source alternatives that lets them keep their data
to software that is backed by large corporate entities. So far she still has the support of her university board, since it values
strategic autonomy.
Her son Kyle on the other hand started out with a degree in Physics and then took one of the newly created RSE Master's courses,
but quickly decided that work in academia with its time limited contracts is not attractive.
Governments around the world are struggling to reposition themselves in this emerging deglobalized world with its new blocks
and therefore have deprioritized publicly funded research. Kyle decided to go to a defense company since they offer a
more secure employment in this polarized world.
\end{story}

\subsection{Education, and changes in the educational system}
Digital competencies in the general population continue to increase, making jumping to software engineering easier than before.

\begin{whatis}{What do we want to have achieved}{academic}
School curricula have embraced the digital transformation, and have included basics of computer interaction
in every class level.
In universities, the first generations of RSE-Master graduates find their way into research departments,
and accelerate the pace of science.
\end{whatis}

\subsection{How have academic Institutions transformed by then?}
\begin{whatis}{What do we want to have achieved}{academic}
Similar to RSEs that are known by 2035 in university boards, we expect to be the concept of RSE units to be in the minds
of academic staff at any level.
We hope to see that universities use the presence of an RSE Department actively as a means to differentiate themselves from other universities.
We hope that the central RSE units have local RSE representatives, or even small RSE groups that handle tasks within a department to oversee specific projects[FIXME: cite group paper].
We also hope, that specialized clusters form that pool the skills of certain specialised RSEs, with certain RSE units specializing in certain tasks like data management, HPC, or visualization.
At universities which have them, we want to see that researchers naturally accept them as part of their used services.
\end{whatis}
Academia, while claiming to be innovative (cite WissZeitVG here), has organisationally often adopted time-scales for change that are more reminiscient to civil services like pension funds.
Nevertheless, the presence, even today, of initiatives like the HiddenRef hints at the potential for specialisation of research tasks. This gives rise to new job descriptions within the academic system such as specialised RSEs or other RTPs.
We have alreadyseen some specialisation trends in recent years such as
the HPC-RSE and AI-RSE which are quite recent developments, whose appeal is stimulated by large public and private investments in HPC facilities and AI technologies.
But we could imagine new RSE specialisations to emerge in the fields
of quantum computing, such as the Quantum-RSE, and in federated online platforms.
% European AI factories: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories
% European federation platform for HPC: https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/paving-way-eurohpc-federation-platform-2024-12-19_en
% European quantum computing: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/quantum

On the other hand the existence of people with a certain specilised skillset opens up possiblities for pooling.
Universities will benefit from pooling these specialists into RSE units, and offer their services to researchers.
Hopefully, these RSE-units are endowed with enough trust by the university boards that translates into stable funding.
With longer-term funding and more trust to pick up longer term projects,
some RSEs can focus on code modernization, cleanup, and modularization,
which can pay off in faster and larger development in the future.
This is an opportunity that would not possible by short-term funded solo RSEs.

\emph{Which challenges will still persist}\\
The workshop participants expect that there will still be budgeting and administrative hurdles to creating
permanent and well-funded RSE teams.
While we hope that the barrier to researchers diminishes, the workshop participants
still expect some work to do. We hope that the compartmentalization that occurs will help researchers reprioritize their workload.
An upcoming challenge will be that, with the emergence of more dedicated RSE units,
networking between them will come into the foreground, because there should be a strong need to share best practices
among institutions with successful RSE Teams.
On a more organisational level, we expect the sharing of models on how how to organise diiferent RSEs, to fit the different organisational constraints.
After that Organisations will have to come up with models for hiring people.
While a standardized RSE Master's makes it easier, it will be interesting to see if
RSE are still often hired by word of mouth within an organisation(``I have this PhD here, before their PostDoc they would be a good fit for the RSE department...'' ) or if the RSE master's degree ensures a hiring process on a more standardised level.

\begin{story}{Changes to the Universities}{changes}
Kim found work years ago at one of the first RSE units in Arcadia. After a couple of years he moved to the university of
Avalon which was interested in setting up their own department for RSEs in order to not fall behind the university of Arcadia.
Kim applies his experiences and improves upon the model set forth by the University of Arcadia. Since the university
of Avalon has to follow different rules not everything can be straightforwardly adapted. Life would be so much easier,
if at least university regulations would be homogenized, no?
\end{story}

\emph{New challenges}
If we follow the ideas laid out in (FIXME: cite RSE group paper), then in addition to university wide RSE units,
there will be embedded RSEs in the departments. Shaping and developing these network bonds will be a task for the future.
While networking embedded RSEs and RSE units is essential for building robust, sustainable research software infrastructure, but the question arises whether every group truly needs to host and manage its own infrastructure(FIXME: maybe cite this here: https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/infrastructure/lis/funding-opportunities/research-software-infrastructures).
When each team or institution hosts its own systems, this often leads to siloed environments where resources, expertise, and data are isolated, limiting collaboration and creating inefficiencies. Such silos can result in duplicated efforts, higher costs, and challenges in maintaining data integrity and governance, as each group independently manages similar infrastructure and workflows. While local control offers flexibility, it also increases complexity and makes it harder to share innovations or best practices across the wider research community. To overcome these challenges, federated infrastructure models are needed, enabling shared access, interoperability, and coordinated development while still allowing for some local autonomy(FIXME: maybe cite this here: https://eurise-network.github.io/).
Federated approaches break down silos, promote knowledge exchange, and ensure that infrastructure investments benefit the broader ecosystem rather than just isolated groups

\subsection{Impact of Alternate Career Paths for Researchers on the Structure of Research Institutes}
\begin{whatis}{What do we want to have achieved}{academic}
We would like to see the emergence of more dedicated personel, i.e. other RTPs next to the RSE.
\end{whatis}
RSEs can either be embedded in research groups (belonging to the mid-level university staff),
or be members of larger RSE units. (TODO: Cite RSE groups paper)
The participants had the opinion that focusing on embedded RSEs would make onboarding new RSEs to existing projects easier.
This, however, comes with additional funding challenges,
as long-term funding is more difficult to acquire in lower levels of an organization.
Third-party funding can mitigate this issue in the mid-term.
However, the participants considered central RSE groups more likely in the future,
due to the fact that there are already examples and activities from various universities in this direction
(examples include the universities of Jena, Heidelberg, Göttingen).
We expect funding in central groups to evolve from initially temporary positions to permanent positions,
as the groups themselves prove themselves valuable.
Embedded RSEs and central groups will need to network with each other,
and potentially request and coordinate support from external RSEs.

\section{What is in this future for RSEs and where to go from here?}
FG-NOTE: I think we can use this part to wrap things a bit up, and describe how this future then looks like.
GC-NOTE: Shall we add another story box here? Ideas what we write here?

Digitalisation will lead to changes in the way societies interact and therefore will translate
into changes in how academia perceives itself. The differentiation of job profiles in academia,
that has started with profiles such as the RSE will continue. Societies will be facing new questions, that arise
from technologies such as generally available AI systems. RSEs will very likely be doing different work,
than what they are doing today, but their core task of enhancing the scientific output of researchers, other human
beings, will stay the same.
They will still develop software artifacts together with scientists,
since Better software leads to better research,
better research leads to more better software.
