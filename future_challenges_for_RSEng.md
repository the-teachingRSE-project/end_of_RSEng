abstract: "
Admittedly; it’s still only 2025 and we are actually working on establishing Research Software Engineering
as a new domain with the hope of ensuring that it gets the recognition it deserves.
And while it is certainly too early to already herald the end of RSEng,
we should acknowledge that the future is in constant flux and
it is worthwhile to discuss how RSEng will/could change in response to these upcoming challenges in an open discussion.

# Introduction
- Why do we do this
- workshop


# The Situation
In order to give a more explicit setting, imagine a world ten years from now.
Not too much, to be overwhelmingly far in the future, but distant enough for some changes to occur.
Over this timeframe Kim and Kay
were able to ride the waves of their career in Research Software Engineering and are now pondering early retirement on a sunset blessed beach.
But the world has moved on.
When they look back, what will they see as problems which are now solved?
Which tasks are persisting, where they are now happy that a younger generation is now taking up the baton and carries forward their work.
What issues have newly emerged, where they are now just happy to say: “Oh well… My successor takes care of that”.

# Aspects of this future

## Which are the topics that we want to have achieved by 2035?

## How have academic Institutions transformed by then?

## Definition of RSEs? How will that evolve in ten years? What will not change in the essence of an RSE ten years from now?

## How will RSE change in the face of the ongoing digitalization of society?
Here we consider how the topics of RSEng will change in the face of the digitalization of society.
Also here: What will our topics be after version control doesn’t need to be taught anymore? Digitalisation will also feature more heavily in the domain curricula.

## How will Education of digital knowledge

## How will AI impact our work?
Is it better than cheap PhDs?

## Where has abstraction brought us, and which complexities are now hidden behind it?
- Here we would need a catchy word, that I think should exist out there. Is it Interface? Encapsulation?
Is there a word for "abstracting sth. away?"

## What are new tasks of RTPs?

## Are we assuming that progress will bring prosperity? Will we remain constrained by needing to produce products/artifacts?

## What is in this future for RSEs?


# REALLY Long-term(10+ years) aspects
Technically this would mean taking everything from the previous section for granted and look
at what becomes now possible.
