### Mode of Operation


### The Situation
Yes I understand it; it's still only [2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izQB2-Kmiic) and we are actually working on establishing Research Software Engineering 
as a new domain with the hope of ensuring that it gets the recognition it deserves.
And while it is certainly too early to already herald the end of RSEng, 
we should acknowledge that the future is in constant flux and 
it is worthwhile to discuss how RSEng will/could change in response to these upcoming challenges in an open discussion.

In order to give a more explicit setting, imagine a world ten years from now.
Not too much, to be overwhelmingly far in the future, but distant enough for some changes to occur.
Over this timeframe [Kim](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-295/v2) and [Kay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11457) 
were able to ride the waves of their career in Research Software Engineering and are now pondering early retirement on a sunset blessed beach.
But the world has moved on.
When they look back, what will they see as problems which are now solved?
Which tasks are persisting, where they are now happy that a younger generation is now taking up the baton and carries forward their work.
What issues have newly emerged, where they are now just happy to say: "Oh well... My successor takes care of that".

In this general setting here are some specific questions that we can use as conversation starters:

- Which are the topics that we want to have achieved by 2035?
- Definition of RSEs? How will that evolve in ten years? What will not change in the essence of an RSE ten years from now?
- How will RSE change in the face of the ongoing digitalization of society? If people are better prepared in school?
- How will AI impact our work? Is it better than cheap PhDs?
- What will our topics be after version control doesn’t need to be taught anymore? Digitalisation will also feature more heavily in the domain curricula.
- Where has abstraction brought us, and which complexities are now hidden behind it?
- What are new tasks of RTPs?
- What is in this future for RSEs?
- Are we assuming that progress will bring prosperity? Will we remain constrained by needing to produce products/artifacts?

#### Logistics
Rest assured, Beer and Wine is served in the other building. Maybe chilled.

#### Epilogue
Maybe we have a good and meaningful story to tell, that we can write an interesting blog post out of that: "The Futurist-RSE". 

#### Abbreviations
VCS = Version Control System
RTP = Research Technical Professional

#### Session Notes
Kim and Kay were described as RSEs in publications linked above.

##### Definition of RSEs? 
Two facets: how will work of RSEs be different? and what will not change over that timeframe?
Definition of RSEs: we will still have a spectrum. Some professionalised RSEs but will still have a broad range fo scientists doing RSEng.
Upcoming scientists are learning some SE principles, so feel that merging will take place. People will specialise in domains, but everyone will be an RSE on some level.
One thing that will not change: something somewhat unique to RSEs is need to remain flexible, change with the latest developments. Keep an eye open and pick up tools and skills as needed as we go along.
What is the current definition? Often fuzzily defined at the moment. Are RSEs really full SEs working on Research Software, or do researchers who code count? Because if the latter, a lot of those "future scientists" who code will still not be RSEs.
9/10 students at the moment have never written a script beyond maybe Hello World when they start a Masters thesis. If that increases over time it will probably be from personal interest since undergraduate curriculum is not changing to include programming, let alone SE classes. 
Hope for future is that training of scientists will include raising awareness/visibility of RSEs and how they can help them.
We see trend to hire more RSEs "in house". I think we will see more institutes with at least a few people with permanent positions as RSEs. Hard to win these positions, fight (with budget holders?)
Major problem is limited term contracts, so you end up with people coming too late to projects that require RSEng.
We will probably still need good education in software approaches for researchers.
Still need to enjoy having broad knowledge, communicating with different people.
One perspective that all researchers will end up coding; another that everywhere will have a team of dedicated RSEs. I think this will only give different challenges, not solve problems.
    so what are those problems going to be?
    I hope/assume there will be more permanent positions for RSEs. COmpartmentalisation helps researchers with workload. Specialisation like this has been seen in other sectors. Overall it increases productivity. More need for exchange between RSEs and domain scientists: it brings up a lot of new problems in expectation management.
    help researchers become more aware that they are not the best software developers and there are other people who are there to do this for them. Help people leanr that they can collaborate with RSes and how to do that effectively.
    I am less optimistic, because of ongoing digitalisation. Feels like we are at a crossroads with big commercial players beginning to dominate e.g. in schools. Technical complexities that will always be present in research may be abstracted away in earlier stages of education. Complexities get hidden, meaning that people do not learn how to overcome these, and places burden on RSEs to produce software with better user experience. Worried about growing mismatch between expectations.
    programming used to be relatively simple, and is now much more complex. expect that complexity to continue to increase. making complex software easy to use is where RSEs need to be involved.
    People who get most from genAI are those who do not need to rely on it. Easy to generate stuff which makes a greater burden for debugging. 
    We hear reports that performance in SE has dropped this year, which we suspect may be due to reliance on genAI.
    I would love to believe that all researchers will know how to do some coding in ten years. But saw numbers yesterday that several states in Germany will not make CS (in a broad sense) mandatory at school level.
    Of course some schools will have optional programming.
    AI will get better. Researchers will be using it too, so we can expect pace of research cycle to increase.
    Fears have existed for a long time about new technologies reducing critical thinking/imagination etc.
    Is this an ethical situation? How will AI improve if humans cannot remain able to think through these things?
    Agree that AI will get better, but whether that increases pace of research cycle depends on incentive structure provided to researchers by the system.
    Re: no CS teaching in schools. Should we make a point to invite policy makers to conferences like this one?
    GI has been lobbyong about this for years. Some progress in some places but still the chalenge is convincing people to make space.
    Working in after-school program at private schools, elementary level. Basic concepts of programming through to intro to robotics. Works well with students who have always been interested in those things. Common factor between them is what they have got from their parents. Big observation bias: you only see this when the kids are older and skills become applicable.
I like the way we work (at Göttingen), and would expect that we will have RSE teams at universities that are specialised in different aspects e.g. data vis, data management, etc. Results in more outsourcing of development, rather than every researcher needing to be involved in the engineering of software for their research.
We need some way to share these things.
I hope we can have both: specialists and a general improvement in computer literacy.
If we don't expect researchers to code, why do we expect SEs to know everything about research practices? Will this not be asking too much?
This is the kind of discussion we shopuld have more. We have a similar model (ETH Zurich), central pool of developers with different specialisms. We need to compare notes, brainstorm different models that might work.
I hope that, whatever challenges we face, in ten years the average RSEng environment is diverse and vibrant. That we can connect with domains so far under-represented in RSE community. Foster an open community. Valuable contribution on its own.

##### Possibility of requirement for RSEs to contribute to development of weaponry/military applications?
Important to talk about ethics in all domains of research. E.g. physicists and mathematicians need to be aware of how solvers can be used e.g. to simulate nuclear bombs. You need to be equipped to evaluate where your ow "red lines" are, and judge when you can choose to walk away or not.
Another future ethics problem is increasing capture of all things coding by increasingly small number of corporations. Is it on us to develop alternative solutions? (There is a workshop related to this tomorrow.)

##### Which are the topics that we want to have achieved by 2035?
I hope we can achieve better systems for citing software used in research.
